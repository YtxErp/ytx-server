# YTX Server

YTX Server is a Rust-based backend server that provides WebSocket communication, database management, and Vault integration for secure credential handling. It is designed for high concurrency and security, leveraging async Rust and modern libraries.

## Features

- **WebSocket Server:** Handles real-time client connections and messaging.
- **Database Hub:** Manages PostgreSQL connections and SQL generation.
- **Vault Integration:** Securely retrieves and renews secrets from HashiCorp Vault.
- **Configurable:** Uses environment variables for flexible deployment.
- **Async & Scalable:** Built with Tokio for high performance.

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

| Variable             | Default                             | Description                                                                                    |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VAULT_ROLE_ID`      | *(none)*                            | Vault role ID used to authenticate the server. **Must** be set.                                |
| `VAULT_SECRET_ID`    | *(none)*                            | Vault secret ID corresponding to `VAULT_ROLE_ID`. **Must** be set.                             |
| `RUST_LOG`           | `error,warn,info`                   | Logging level for the server. Can be customized.                                               |
| `BASE_POSTGRES_URL`  | `postgres://localhost:5432`         | Base URL for connecting to PostgreSQL. Can be customized.                                      |
| `VAULT_ADDR`         | `"http://127.0.0.1:8200"`           | Vault server address. Can be customized.                                                       |
| `LISTEN_ADDR`        | `127.0.0.1:7749`                    | IP and port for the server to listen on. Can be customized.                                    |
| `AUTH_DB`            | `ytx_auth`                          | Database storing YTX role and workspace info. **Must** match the database created by InitDB.   |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- HashiCorp Vault (for secret management)
- Initial Database Setup (MUST RUN FIRST)
  - Before starting the server, you **must** initialize the authentication and main databases, as well as create required PostgreSQL roles and permissions.
  - For detailed instructions, please refer to [ytx-initdb](https://github.com/YtxErp/ytx-initdb).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YtxErp/ytx-server.git
    cd ytx-server
    ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

    - Copy `env_template.text` to `.env` and fill in your values.
    - Example variables:

        ```env
        BASE_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://localhost:5432
        VAULT_ADDR=<http://127.0.0.1:8200>
        VAULT_ROLE_ID=
        VAULT_SECRET_ID=
        LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7749
        AUTH_DB=ytx_auth
        ```

3. **Build the project:**

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

4. **Run the server:**

    ```sh
    cargo run --release
    ```

## Usage

- The server listens for WebSocket connections on the address specified by `LISTEN_ADDR`.
- It connects to PostgreSQL using credentials from Vault or environment variables.
- WebSocket sessions are managed in [`src/websocket/session.rs`](src/websocket/session.rs).
- Database operations are handled via [`src/dbhub/`](src/dbhub/).

## Development

- Code is organized by feature (config, dbhub, message, vault, websocket).
- Use `.env` for local development configuration.
- See [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) for application startup logic.
